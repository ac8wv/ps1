Title: Problem Set 1 Answers
Author: <Aditi Chaudhry>

Problem 1. The following is the User-Agent string reported by my browser: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.63 Safari/537.36

This string states that I am using version 5.0 of Mozilla. The (X11; Linux i686) gives the details of the system which I'm running my browser on. In this case I am running my browser on a Linux system. The platform the browser uses is represented by AppleWebKit/537.36. The KHTML, like Gecko gives the browser platform details. Finally, the last section of this string indicates the specific enhancements taht are available directly in the browser. I learned this information from the wikipedia page on User Agents.  

Problem 2: Rust thinks it is unsafe to modify a global variable like this because of concurrency issues and race conditions.
